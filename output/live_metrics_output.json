  "explanation": "The provided context does not include specific details about the web service, but it is assumed to be a web application that accepts HTTP requests and provides responses. Based on this assumption, we derived two SLOs: a latency target for response times and an error rate limit over a specified time window. The corresponding SLIs were extracted from available monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Datadog. Alert rules were defined to notify of potential issues when the SLO targets are exceeded. To improve reliability, suggestions include adding additional resources during peak load times or implementing request caching.",
  "llm_suggestions": [
    "Implement canary deployments to gradually roll out updates and reduce the risk of service disruption.",
    "Add custom metrics for tracking specific aspects of your application's behavior, such as database queries or third-party APIs."
