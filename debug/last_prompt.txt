You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Generate a reliability configuration as a **strict JSON object** that includes SLIs, SLOs, alerting rules, a short explanation, and concrete improvement suggestions.

**QUANTITY TARGETS:**
- Generate approximately 3 SLIs (aim for 3 ± 2)
- Generate approximately 2 SLOs (aim for 2 ± 1)
- Generate approximately 1 alerts (aim for 1 ± 1)
- Generate approximately 4 suggestions (aim for 4 ± 2)

🛑 STRICT FIELD RULES:
- All required fields must be present and non-empty.
- The top-level 'slo' key MUST always be present, even if empty.
- For SLI objects, the `type` field must be one of: "latency", "error", "availability", "throughput", "queue", "saturation", "utilization", "custom".
- Do NOT leave any required field as an empty string, empty list, or null.
- If unsure, use a sensible default (e.g., "custom" for SLI type).
- Every SLO, SLI, and alert object MUST include a non-empty, descriptive "name" field. Do NOT omit or leave the "name" field empty for any object. If unsure, use a placeholder like 'unnamed-alert'.

📌 ONLY return a strict JSON object with closed brackets and quoted values.  
❌ DO NOT return markdown, YAML, comments, or natural language outside of the JSON.  
✅ DO NOT return empty strings or empty lists unless data truly doesn't apply.  

Your output **must** follow this exact structure and format:

{
  "sli": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "type": "latency | error | availability | throughput | queue | saturation | utilization | custom",

      "source": "prometheus | datadog | cloudwatch | stackdriver | grafana | newrelic | custom",
      "metric": "string"
    }
  ],
  "slo": [
    {

      "severity": "info | warning | critical",
      "expr": "string",
      "for": "5m | 10m | 30m"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Explain why these SLOs and alerts were chosen and how they relate to the service's purpose and observed metrics.",
  "llm_suggestions": [
    {
      "metric": "string",
      "recommendation": "Provide a specific, actionable optimization or monitoring improvement for the selected metric, including concrete numbers (e.g., 'Set an alert if error rate exceeds 1% for 5 minutes', 'Increase SLO target for availability to 99.95%', or 'Trigger a page if latency > 200ms for 3 consecutive checks')."
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: ONLY return a valid JSON object. Do not include any comments, markdown, or trailing commas. All property names and string values must be in double quotes.

- All recommendations in 'llm_suggestions' must include at least one concrete number (threshold, percentage, duration, etc.).
- Avoid vague language; be as specific and actionable as possible.

- The 'alerts' array must always be present and contain actionable, numeric alert definitions (with name, description, threshold, duration, etc.).
- The 'slo' array must always be present, and each SLO must reference an SLI by name, include a numeric target, and a time_window.
- Always include these arrays, even if only one entry is present.

- You MUST always generate at least one actionable, numeric alert and at least one SLO referencing an SLI.
- If no alert or SLO is obvious, create a reasonable default based on the SLIs provided.
- Alerts must have a name, description, threshold, and duration.
- SLOs must reference an SLI by name, include a numeric target, and a time_window.
- Do not leave the 'alerts' or 'slo' arrays empty.

- For each SLI type (availability, latency, error, queue, saturation, utilization, throughput, custom), generate a realistic, actionable SLO and alert as shown above.
- Use the SLI's name/type for the SLO's 'sli' field and for alert descriptions.
- Set numeric targets and thresholds appropriate to the SLI type.
- Do not leave the 'alerts' or 'slo' arrays empty.
