"explanation": "The service has coverage gaps in SLIs, error budget tracking, and dependency monitoring. Current error rate of 0.85% approaches the 1% SLO threshold, indicating potential reliability concerns. Lack of resource saturation monitoring could lead to unintended performance degradation. Optimization opportunities exist for latency reduction and improved user experience.",
