  "explanation": "The decline in AI confidence and output quality suggests that the policy-as-code system may be experiencing issues related to outdated or inaccurate templates, and insufficient training and expertise within the SRE team. To address these issues, implementing a monitoring and alerting system, conducting regular audits of policy-as-code templates, and investing in training for the SRE team are recommended. Additionally, implementing automated testing framework and integrating feedback mechanism into the policy-as-code system can help improve output quality and consistency, as well as increase accuracy of SLI/SLO/Alert generation."
