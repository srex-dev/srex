 "explanation": "The service has good coverage of availability and latency SLIs, but lacks comprehensive error budget tracking and dependency monitoring. Current error rate of 0.85% is approaching the 1% SLO threshold, indicating potential reliability concerns.",
 "llm_suggestions": [
 "Implement error budget burn rate alerting when error rate exceeds 0.3% for 5 minutes to provide early warning before SLO violation",
 "Add SLI for external API response times with alert threshold of 500ms for 10 minutes to monitor third-party dependencies",
 "Implement Redis caching layer to reduce P95 latency from 245ms to target 200ms, expected 20% improvement"
