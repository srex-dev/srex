  "explanation": "The decline in AI confidence and the presence of missing fields in the output indicate a potential lack of maintenance or updates to the LLM model. Implementing a monitoring and alerting system, conducting regular audits, and modifying the SLI/SLO/Alert/Suggestion generation process can help address these issues and improve the overall performance of the policy-as-code system."
