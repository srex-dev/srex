You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to extract structured **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** and corresponding **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** from the provided context. You must also generate potential **alerts**, a clear **explanation**, and additional **llm_suggestions** for improving reliability.

Only return a single **valid JSON object**. Do **not** include markdown, code blocks, or extra commentary outside of the JSON fields.

---

## Required JSON Output Fields:

1. `"slo"` – a list of SLOs each with: `name`, `description`, `sli`, `target`, `time_window`
2. `"sli"` – a list of SLIs with: `name`, `description`, `type`, `unit`, `source`, `metric`
3. `"alerts"` – recommended alert rules, each with: `name`, `description`, `expr`, `for`, `severity`
4. `"explanation"` – paragraph explaining how the SLOs/SLIs/alerts were derived
5. `"llm_suggestions"` – optional tips to improve reliability or observability

---

## Valid SLI `type` values:

- `"latency"` — response time for requests
- `"error"` — error rate or count
- `"availability"` — success or uptime ratio
- `"throughput"` — volume of operations
- `"queue"` — queue length or lag
- `"saturation"` — resource bottlenecks
- `"utilization"` — percentage of resource usage
- `"custom"` — any other service-specific signal

## Valid `source` values:

- `"prometheus"`, `"datadog"`, `"cloudwatch"`, `"newrelic"`, `"stackdriver"`, `"grafana"`, `"custom"`

## Example Output:

{
  "slo": [
    {
      "name": "availability",
      "description": "Ensure 99.9% of HTTP requests succeed over 30 days",
      "sli": "http_success_rate",
      "target": 99.9,
      "time_window": "30d"
    }
  ],
  "sli": [
    {
      "name": "http_success_rate",
      "description": "Percentage of HTTP requests returning 2xx",
      "type": "availability",
      "unit": "percentage",
      "source": "prometheus",
      "metric": "http_requests_total{status=~\"2..\"} / http_requests_total"
    }
  ],
  "alerts": [
    {
      "name": "high_error_rate",
      "description": "Alert if 5xx errors exceed 5% of total requests",
      "expr": "rate(http_errors_total[5m]) / rate(http_requests_total[5m]) > 0.05",
      "for": "10m",
      "severity": "warning"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "The SLO was derived based on HTTP success rate, which is critical for user-facing services. An SLI was defined using Prometheus metrics, and an alert rule was added for high error rates.",
  "llm_suggestions": [
    "Add an SLO for 95th percentile latency.",
    "Include alerts for request queue saturation."
  ]
