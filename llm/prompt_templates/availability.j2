You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to define **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** and the corresponding **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** based on the provided availability targets and service context.

ðŸ›‘ STRICT OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Respond ONLY with a **valid JSON object**
- ALWAYS have explanation and suggestions
- Do NOT include any markdown, comments, or explanatory text
- The response MUST begin with `{` and end with `}`
- All string values must be properly quoted
- PromQL expressions must use escaped quotes (`\\\"`)

## Availability Context

"service_name": "{{ service_name }}"

"objectives": [
{% for obj in objectives %}
  {
    "component": "{{ obj.component }}",
    "availability_target": "{{ obj.availability_target }}",
    "comment": "{{ obj.comment | default("No comment") }}"
  }{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
]

## Output Format

{
  "slo": [
    {% for obj in objectives %}
    {
      "name": "{{ service_name }} - {{ obj.component }} Availability",
      "description": "Availability target for {{ obj.component }} within {{ service_name }}.",
      "sli": "availability_{{ obj.component | replace('-', '_') }}",
      "target": "{{ obj.availability_target }}",
      "time_window": "30d"
    }{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}

  "sli": [
    {% for obj in objectives %}
    {
      "name": "availability_{{ obj.component | replace('-', '_') }}",
      "description": "Ratio of successful responses to total for {{ obj.component }}.",
      "type": "availability",
      "unit": "percentage",
      "source": "prometheus",
      "metric": "sum(rate(http_requests_total{component=\\\"{{ obj.component }}\\\",status=~\\\"2..\\\"}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total{component=\\\"{{ obj.component }}\\\"}[5m]))"
    }{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  ],
  "explanation": "SLIs were derived from availability objectives for each component in {{ service_name }} using Prometheus metrics. Targets are measured over a 30-day window.",
  "llm_suggestions": [
    {
      "metric": "string",
      "recommendation": "Provide a specific, actionable optimization or monitoring improvement for the selected metric, including concrete numbers (e.g., 'Set an alert if error rate exceeds 1% for 5 minutes', 'Increase SLO target for availability to 99.95%', or 'Trigger a page if latency > 200ms for 3 consecutive checks')."
    }
  ],
  "alerts": []
}

- All recommendations in 'llm_suggestions' must include at least one concrete number (threshold, percentage, duration, etc.).
- Avoid vague language; be as specific and actionable as possible.
