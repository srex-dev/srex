You are an SRE expert tasked with generating Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a service. Based on the provided SLIs, create appropriate SLOs that define the service's reliability targets.

Service Information:
- Name: {{ service_name }}
- Type: microservice

Available SLIs:
{% for sli in sli_inputs %}
- Component: {{ sli.component }}
  Type: {{ sli.sli_type }}
  Value: {{ sli.value }}
  Unit: {{ sli.unit }}
  Query: {{ sli.query }}
  Source: {{ sli.source }}
  {% if sli.metadata %}
  Metadata:
    {% if sli.metadata.business_impact %}
    Business Impact:
      - Revenue Impact: {{ sli.metadata.business_impact.revenue_impact }}
      - User Impact: {{ sli.metadata.business_impact.user_impact }}
      {% if sli.metadata.business_impact.compliance_requirements %}
      - Compliance: {{ sli.metadata.business_impact.compliance_requirements | join(', ') }}
      {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endif %}
{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Requirements:
1. Generate SLOs that cover the following aspects:
   - Availability
   - Latency
   - Error Rate
   - Throughput
2. Each SLO should include:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Target value
   - Window
   - Error budget
   - Associated SLIs
3. Consider the service type and its critical components
4. Use appropriate targets based on industry standards
5. Ensure error budgets are reasonable and aligned with business needs

Please provide the SLOs in the following JSON format:
{
  "slos": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "target": number,
      "window": "string",
      "error_budget": number,
      "slis": ["string"],
      "metadata": {
        "business_impact": {
          "revenue_impact": "string",
          "user_impact": "string",
          "compliance_requirements": ["string"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "string",
  "ai_model": "string",
  "temperature": number,
  "ai_confidence": number,
  "metadata": {
    "generated_at": "string",
    "service_name": "string"
  },
  "llm_suggestions": [
    {
      "metric": "string",
      "recommendation": "Provide a specific, actionable optimization or monitoring improvement for the selected metric, including concrete numbers (e.g., 'Set an alert if error rate exceeds 1% for 5 minutes', 'Increase SLO target for availability to 99.95%', or 'Trigger a page if latency > 200ms for 3 consecutive checks')."
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with a single valid JSON object, no explanation, no markdown, no extra text. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.

Additional Context:
- Service is considered critical if downtime affects business operations
- Target availability should be at least 99.9%
- Latency should be measured at the 95th percentile
- Error rate should be less than 0.1%
- Throughput should be measured in requests per second
- All recommendations in 'llm_suggestions' must include at least one concrete number (threshold, percentage, duration, etc.)
- Avoid vague language; be as specific and actionable as possible

# Example SLOs and Alerts for all SLI types:
# SLOs:
# - Availability: Ensure availability >= 99.9% over 30d
# - Latency: 95% of requests < 200ms over 7d
# - Error: Error rate < 1% over 30d
# - Queue: Queue utilization < 90% over 7d
# - Saturation: Saturation < 85% over 7d
# - Utilization: Utilization < 80% over 7d
# - Throughput: Throughput > 80% of current value over 7d
# Alerts:
# - Availability: Alert if < 99% for 10m
# - Latency: Alert if > 200ms for 5m
# - Error: Alert if > 1% for 10m
# - Queue: Alert if > 90% for 10m
# - Saturation: Alert if > 85% for 10m
# - Utilization: Alert if > 80% for 10m
# - Throughput: Alert if < 80% of current value for 10m
#
# For each SLI type, generate a realistic, actionable SLO and alert as above. Use the SLI's name/type for references and descriptions. Set numeric targets and thresholds appropriate to the SLI type. Do not leave the 'alerts' or 'slo' arrays empty.
