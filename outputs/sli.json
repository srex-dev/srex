  "explanation": "The SLIs were derived based on the provided input metrics, focusing on availability, latency, error rates, and queue depth. The 'http_success_rate' SLI is calculated as the ratio of successful requests (status codes 2xx) to total requests. It provides an indication of service availability from a user experience perspective. The 'latency_p95' SLI uses the 95th percentile function to capture and report the latency experienced by 95% of users, which is important for understanding the performance impact on user experience. The 'error_rate' SLI calculates the percentage of requests that result in an error status code, providing insight into service reliability. Lastly, the 'queue_depth' SLI reflects the current state of a queue, often used to gauge system backlog or lag. This SLI is sourced from CloudWatch as it was provided in the input data."
