  "explanation": "The latency target of 150ms for db_latency is based on the expected query complexity during a checkout process, aiming to minimize user wait times and ensure smooth transaction processing. The error rate target of 0.5% for db_error_rate was set to maintain service stability by minimizing potential database-related failures, assuming proper caching and replication strategies are in place to optimize database performance."
