  "explanation": "The latency targets for the checkout-service were chosen based on a combination of expected usage patterns, user experience requirements, and performance constraints. Given the critical nature of this service during the checkout process, even short delays could negatively impact the user experience. Therefore, we have set the target for the 95th percentile latency to be under 200ms, which should provide a smooth and responsive experience for most users. To account for outliers or occasional spikes in traffic, we have also set the target for the 99th percentile latency to be under 500ms."
