  "explanation": "SLOs were selected to protect core aspects of the checkout experience. A 99.9% availability target ensures high uptime. A 95th percentile latency objective captures tail performance while remaining achievable. The checkout error rate is limited to <1% to ensure transactional reliability. A 30-day window was chosen for a balanced observability and reliability horizon."
