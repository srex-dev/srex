  "explanation": "The error budget was calculated based on the SLO target of 99.9% for http_success_rate, which allows for a maximum of 0.1% errors per month (43 minutes in a 30-day period). This error budget allocation strikes a balance between operational tolerance and user expectations by minimizing service disruptions while allowing room for incident response and maintenance. The time-bound constraint ensures that the checkout-service remains responsive and reliable, providing users with a smooth experience."
