  "explanation": "The availability SLO for the checkout-service is set at 99.9% (438 minutes of allowed downtime per month) based on the business criticality of ensuring a smooth user experience during checkout and payment processing, as well as the high user expectations for uninterrupted service. The 1-day time window reflects the typical transaction volume and user behavior patterns throughout the day. Assumptions are made about the load balancing mechanism in place to distribute traffic evenly across replicas, along with redundancy and failover capabilities provided by the deployment setup with 6 replicas across two regions."
