    ]
  },
  "explanation": "The chosen thresholds of 1000 for kafka_lag and 300ms for kafka_processing_latency are based on the assumption that our checkout-service handles a relatively high throughput of messages due to the number of concurrent users. These limits aim to provide a smooth user experience while balancing performance and backlog tolerance. Additionally, it is assumed that the autoscaling feature will help manage increased demand by scaling up the number of replicas as needed."
