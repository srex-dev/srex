You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to define **error budgets** for a backend service based on its SLO targets.

Only output a single valid **JSON** object. Do not include markdown, code fences, or natural language explanations outside of the `explanation` key. The JSON must include two top-level keys:

1. "slo" — contains the complete SLO definition including its allowable error budget.  
2. "explanation" — a single string explaining the reasoning behind the error budget allocation.

## Context  
{input}

## Required Output Structure (JSON):  
{
  "slo": {
    "service_name": "checkout-service",
    "description": "Handles user checkout and payment processing",
    "objectives": [
      {
        "name": "http_success_rate",
        "sli": "availability",
        "target": 99.9,
        "time_window": "30d",
        "description": "Maintain 99.9% success rate, allowing a 0.1% error budget (43 minutes/month of potential failure)."
      }
    ]
  },
  "explanation": "Describe how the error budget was calculated and how it aligns with operational tolerance, incident response plans, and user expectations. Include time-bound constraints and tradeoffs."
}
