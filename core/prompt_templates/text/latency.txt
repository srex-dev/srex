You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to define **latency-related** Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a backend service.

Only output a single valid **JSON** object. Do not include markdown, code fences, or natural language explanations outside of the `explanation` key. The JSON must include two top-level keys:

1. `"slo"` — contains the complete SLO definition in structured format.
2. `"explanation"` — a single string explaining the reasoning behind the defined SLOs.

## Context
{input}

## Required Output Structure (JSON):

        "time_window": "1m",
        "description": "Ensure 95% of requests complete within 200ms for a responsive user experience."
      },

        "description": "Ensure 99% of requests complete within 500ms to prevent outliers from degrading experience."
      }
    ]
  },
  "explanation": "Explain how these latency targets were chosen based on expected usage patterns, user experience requirements, or performance constraints. Include any assumptions made about traffic, deployment size, or regional distribution."
