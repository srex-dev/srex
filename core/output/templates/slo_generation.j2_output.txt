"explanation": "The service level objectives (SLOs) define the reliability targets for the payment service. The availability SLO aims to ensure that the service is available at least 99.9% of the time. The latency SLO aims to ensure that the service responds within 0.45 seconds at the 95th percentile. The error rate SLO aims to reduce the number of errors occurring in the service to less than 0.0005 per 5 minutes. These targets are based on industry standards and align with business needs.",
