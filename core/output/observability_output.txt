      "explanation": "The SLIs selected are common indicators of service performance and reliability, such as latency (response time) and error rate for HTTP requests. The associated SLOs define clear targets that reflect the desired level of service quality. Alert policies are configured based on these SLIs and their respective SLOs to notify when they are not being met. These settings should help maintain a consistent user experience while ensuring timely resolution of issues.",
