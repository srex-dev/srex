You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to define **queue-related** Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a backend service.

Only output a single valid **JSON** object. Do not include markdown, code fences, or natural language explanations outside of the `explanation` key. The JSON must include two top-level keys:

1. "slo" — contains the complete SLO definition in structured format.  
2. "explanation" — a single string explaining the reasoning behind the defined SLOs.

## Context  
{input}

## Required Output Structure (JSON):  
{
  "slo": {
    "service_name": "checkout-service",
    "description": "Handles user checkout and payment processing",
    "objectives": [
      {
        "name": "kafka_lag",
        "sli": "queue",
        "target": 1000,
        "time_window": "5m",
        "description": "Maintain Kafka lag below 1000 messages to ensure real-time message processing."
      },
      {
        "name": "kafka_processing_latency",
        "sli": "queue",
        "target": 300,
        "time_window": "5m",
        "description": "Keep Kafka message processing latency under 300ms for timely event handling."
      }
    ]
  },
  "explanation": "Explain why these queue thresholds were chosen based on backlog tolerance, event criticality, or processing capacity. Mention assumptions about throughput or autoscaling."
