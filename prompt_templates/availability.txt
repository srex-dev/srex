You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to define **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** and the corresponding **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** based on the provided availability targets and service context.

Only return a valid **JSON** object. Do not include markdown, code blocks, or natural language outside the required fields.

> ⚠️ All metric expressions must be valid JSON: escape double quotes with backslashes (e.g., `=~\\"2..\\"`).

---

## Required Top-Level Keys:

1. `"slo"` — a list of structured Service Level Objectives  
2. `"sli"` — a list of SLIs derived from the objectives  
3. `"explanation"` — a paragraph explaining how the SLOs and SLIs were chosen  
4. `"llm_suggestions"` — optional ideas for improving availability

---

## SLO Format:

Each object in `"slo"` must include:

- `"name"`: Unique identifier  
- `"description"`: What the SLO ensures  
- `"sli"`: Name of the associated SLI  
- `"target"`: Availability goal (e.g., `0.999`)  ← ⚠️ no quotes
- `"time_window"`: Time window for evaluation (e.g., `"1d"`, `"7d"`)

---

## SLI Format:

Each object in `"sli"` must include:

- `"name"`: Unique name  
- `"description"`: What it measures  
- `"type"`: Always `"availability"`  
- `"unit"`: e.g., `"percentage"`  
- `"source"`: Monitoring platform (e.g., `"prometheus"`)  
- `"metric"`: PromQL or equivalent expression

      "availability_target": 0.999,
      "component": "http-api",
      "comment": "Critical endpoint must be available"
    }
