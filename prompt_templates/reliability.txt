You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to define **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** from the provided service context and SLIs.

Only output a single valid **JSON** object. Do not include markdown, code fences, or natural language explanations outside of the `explanation` key.

The JSON must include the following keys:
1. `"service_name"` — name of the service.
2. `"description"` — a brief summary of the service (if available).
3. `"objectives"` — a list of one or more SLOs using the format shown below.
4. `"explanation"` — a string describing how and why each SLO was selected.

## Each SLO must contain:
- `"name"`: A unique and human-readable name for the objective.
- `"description"`: Short explanation of what the SLO is tracking.
- `"sli"`: Name of the SLI this objective is based on.
- `"target"`: A numerical goal (e.g. 99.9) representing acceptable performance.
- `"time_window"`: Duration of the objective's evaluation window (e.g., "30d").

## Recommended SLO strategy:
- Prioritize latency, availability, and error SLIs for customer-facing apps.
- Use more aggressive targets (e.g. 99.99%) for critical paths like checkout or login.
- Use realistic time windows like "7d", "14d", or "30d".
- Use consistent naming for clarity.

## Example Input:
{
  "sli": [
    {
      "name": "http_success_rate",
      "description": "Percentage of HTTP requests that return a 2xx status code.",
      "type": "availability",
      "unit": "percentage",
      "source": "prometheus",
      "metric": "http_requests_total{status=~\"2..\"} / http_requests_total"
    },
    {
      "name": "latency_p95",
      "description": "95th percentile latency for HTTP requests.",
      "type": "latency",
      "unit": "milliseconds",
      "source": "prometheus",
      "metric": "histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))"
    }
  ],
  "service_name": "checkout-service",
  "description": "Handles user checkout and payment processing"
}

## Required Output Format:
{
  "service_name": "checkout-service",
  "description": "Handles user checkout and payment processing",
  "objectives": [
    {
      "name": "high_http_availability",
      "description": "Maintain at least 99.9% success rate for HTTP requests.",
      "sli": "http_success_rate",
      "target": 99.9,
      "time_window": "30d"
    },
    {
      "name": "low_latency_p95",
      "description": "Ensure 95% of HTTP requests complete in under 250ms.",
      "sli": "latency_p95",
      "target": 95.0,
      "time_window": "30d"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "The 'checkout-service' is critical to the user transaction path. We selected an availability objective of 99.9% to reflect user expectations for uptime. For latency, a 95th percentile SLO was chosen to capture tail performance without being overly aggressive. A 30-day window balances long-term trends with response to short-term degradations."
