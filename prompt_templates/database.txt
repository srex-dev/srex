You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to define **database-related** Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a backend service.

Only output a single valid **JSON** object. Do not include markdown, code fences, or natural language explanations outside of the `explanation` key. The JSON must include two top-level keys:

1. "slo" — contains the complete SLO definition in structured format.  
2. "explanation" — a single string explaining the reasoning behind the defined SLOs.

## Context  
{input}

## Required Output Structure (JSON):  
{
  "slo": {
    "service_name": "checkout-service",
    "description": "Handles user checkout and payment processing",
    "objectives": [
      {
        "name": "db_latency",
        "sli": "database",
        "target": 150,
        "time_window": "5m",
        "description": "Ensure database query latency remains under 150ms to support fast transaction processing."
      },
      {
        "name": "db_error_rate",
        "sli": "database",
        "target": 0.005,
        "time_window": "1d",
        "description": "Ensure database error rate stays below 0.5% to maintain service stability."
      }
    ]
  },
  "explanation": "Justify these database targets based on expected query complexity, SLA requirements, or observed trends in latency and failure. Include assumptions about caching or replication if relevant."
}
