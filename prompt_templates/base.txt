You are a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your task is to define {template_type}-related SLOs for a service.

Only output valid YAML. Do not include markdown or code fences.

## Context
{input}

## Instructions
Generate SLOs in YAML starting with `service_name:` and include:

- indicators (if needed)
- objectives (with name, sli, target, time_window, and description)

Your YAML should be followed by a section named `explanation:` which includes reasoning for the SLOs.
